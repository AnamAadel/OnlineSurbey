    <h1>Project Setup Guide</h1>

    <p>Welcome to our project! Follow these steps to set up your development environment and start contributing.</p>

    <h2>Clone the Repository</h2>

    <p>Begin by cloning the full repository to your local machine:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>git clone https://github.com/AnamAadel/OnlineSurbey
cd OnlineSurbey
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Install Dependencies</h2>

    <p>Once you are in the project directory, install the required dependencies using npm:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>npm install</code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Run the Project</h2>

    <p>To run the project locally, execute the following command:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>npm run dev</code>
    </pre>

    <p>This will start the development server, and you can access the project at <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a>.</p>

    <h2>Building for Deployment</h2>

    <p>Before submitting your work, make sure to build the project by running:</p>

    <pre>
        <code>npm run build</code>
    </pre>

    <p>Check for any errors in your updates. If there are no issues, proceed to push your changes to the repository.</p>

    <h2>Push Your Work</h2>

    <p>Remember not to push directly to the main branch. Follow these steps:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Commit your changes:</li>
        <pre>
            <code>
git add .
git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
            </code>
        </pre>

        <li>Push your changes to your branch (replace <code>your-branch</code> with the name of your branch):</li>
        <pre>
            <code>git push origin your-branch</code>
        </pre>
    </ol>

    <p>Inform Sadat or Anamul that your work is done, and they will merge it into the main branch.</p>

    <h2>Feedback and Merging</h2>

    <p>After pushing your changes, our team will review your work. If everything looks good, Sadat or Anamul will merge your branch into the main branch and provide feedback.</p>

    <p>Thank you for your contribution! If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to the team.</p>
